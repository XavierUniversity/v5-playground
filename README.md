# v5 Playground

- Basic playground for all things v5 related.
- Provides us with a web experience to play with as we build out various things.

## Requirements

1. No Frameworks (Foundation/Bootstrap/Bourbon) allowed -- everything is coded by us, for us.
2. Use FlexBox and CSS Grids -- Support is only getting better, all major browsers already support these.
3. Use the [8-pt layout](https://blog.prototypr.io/the-8pt-grid-consistent-spacing-in-ui-design-with-sketch-577e4f0fd520)
  1. Base font size is 16px; 1rem == 16px
  2. 0.5rem == 8px
  3. 2rem == 32px
4. Follow the [ITCSS Methodology](https://blog.codeminer42.com/how-to-organize-your-styles-with-itcss-3787cbc6dcbf)
5. Don't worry about breaking things. This is a playground.

## Setup

We'll be using a similar setup in here as we did for Xavier One (browsersync, sass) and one additional
piece called HTML includes. No reason to have this run PHP as it's just a playground.

## Getting started

Clone the repository, `npm start` should get it rolling.
