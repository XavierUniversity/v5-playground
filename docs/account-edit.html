                            Xavier University Singers is a student run, auditioned performance group comprised of around 15-20 students from all majors and class levels. The students work rigorously to put on 1-2 shows each semester. Shows consist of dancing, comedy, and, of course, a whole lot of singing. All routines are expertly choreographed and accompanied by a  live band of Xavier students. The song repertoire consists of selections from traditional Broadway Musicals, Vocal Jazz, Pop, Rock, and even Country. Recent shows have included a college themed show, as well as a show about selling-out (Advertisements, but also musicians selling out). Keeping involved, the group stays active with various fundraising and events.                          </p>

Club Fencing competes against 21 other teams in the Midwestern Fencing Conference (MFC) throughout the year, including the MFC Championship Tournament. Club Fencing is also part of the United States Association of Collegiate Fencing Clubs (USACFC) and competes in the USACFC national championship tournament against approximately 40 other teams. Many of the members also compete in the United States Fencing Association (USFA) independently from team competition in order to pursue individual ranking and recognition. 

Xavier Club Fencing is open to fencers of all experience and skill levels. It is a great opportunity for students to be introduced to fencing and learn the sport at a high economic value, and for experienced fencers to further develop their skills in a competitive environment. Club Fencing is a strong community of teammates and friends that offers a support system for our members so that all Xavier fencers can find opportunities to grow as an athlete and as a person.                          </p>

                            The Club Golf team is in its 10th year as a Club Sport at Xavier. Its inaugural season was in the Fall of 2007. The club has had constant growth since the first season, in both the number of team members and college teams that they compete against. Club Golf competes against colleges across the Midwest, including Miami (OH), Dayton, Ohio State, Louisville, Wright State, Ohio University, and Cincinnati.

Along with one on one matches against some of these college club teams, the Xavier team joined the National Collegiate Club Golf Association (NCCGA) in the Spring 2010 season. The NCCGA is a league where college club golf teams come together to compete in two regional tournaments with a chance to travel to the national tournament to compete against the best college club teams in the United States.                          </p>

                            The Club Sports Council is designed to serve the interests of Xavier University by providing opportunities for Xavier University students, faculty, and staff to continue participating or learn a new sport/recreational activity. While Club Sports fall on a competitive level between intramurals and intercollegiate athletics, the member's involvement in the Clubs is structured to be a learning experience for the members through their involvement in the organization and administration of club activities as well as the development of sports skills.

As the members are active participants in the leadership and decision making process of the clubs, clubs may vary in focus and programming. The teams hold practices two to four times per week and all of clubs are required to have a coach. The clubs do not have large budgets; therefore the clubs must fundraise and charge membership dues to subsidize their existence. The teams compete against other club teams from universities throughout the Midwest such as Indiana University, University of Kentucky, Ohio State University, Miami of Ohio, and the University of Cincinnati. Many of the club sports play in leagues and can compete for a national championship. Participation in the Club Sports Council is an excellent way to develop leadership skills, meet new friends with similar interests, stay in shape and enhance athletic skills.                          </p>

                            Members of The Gathering play various table-top, card and board games that fit the fantasy genre such as MTG, Dungeons and Dragons (and RPG in general) and Munchkin.

                            Mock Trial Team is a club that consists of students interested in law or acting. Students interested in law have the option to play the role of a mock attorney, and students who are interested in acting have the option to play a mock witness (without having to do the legal work). However, students do have the option of playing the part of both an attorney and a witness. All members will assist in preparing the case given, and all members compete in invitationals at the regional tournament, the super-regional tournament, and potentially the national tournament. Each tournament consists of four rounds. During each round the mock attorneys and witnesses present one side of the case against another school's team in a courtroom. 

The overall purpose of Mock Trial Team is to develop legal and trial skills and to prepare prospective law students for law school and the legal world. Members will gain trial experience in a "mock" setting and also learn from a team of Cincinnati area attorneys and former Mock Trial participants who serve as coaches.                          </p>

The objectives of the program include: improve students' understanding of the importance of higher education - ultimately increasing their desire to attend college, boost students social and emotional health, and create strong relationships with positive role models.

Mini Muskies has a long history of accomplishing the aforementioned objectives. For example, students measurably increased their self-esteem, hope, and problem-solving skills. Additionally, the program increased students' views of the importance of school and their ability to succeed academically as well as their plans to attend college. The one-on-one relationship building through mentorship has been a rewarding and uplifting factor for both Xavier and St. Francis students. Mini Muskies is looking for mentors willing to be part of this yearlong commitment to the program.                          </p>

                            Life After Sunday provides students with practical means for integrating their Catholic faith into everyday life. Life After Sunday does this primarily by praying the Rosary, studying the Bible, sponsoring Eucharistic Adoration, hosting Lord's Day dinners, and hosting Holy Power Hours. The club chose the name "Life After Sunday" because they think that living the Catholic faith is more than just going to Sunday Mass. To live a truly authentic Catholic life, we are called to seek Christ daily through prayer.                          </p>
